# Old documentation

Kachery is a Python package, command-line tool and an optional content-addressable storage server
that lets you store files and directories in local or remote content-addressable
storage databases. Those files may then be represented by hash URLs. Here are
some examples

```
sha1://25d74fb08ea3e238255ba76efe1cf21c9e8c7db1/some_file.npy
md5://b8355743c06a9944fbd5d1790a894483/another_file.csv
```

You can also represent snapshots of entire directories... for example:

```
sha1dir://615aa23efde8898aa89002613e20ad59dcde42f9.hybrid_janelia/drift_siprobe/rec_16c_1200s_11
```

Those strings are now universal pointers to the underlying file content, which
can be retrieved as part of Python scripts and other applications. In this way
we separate the representation of files from their underlying locations.
This provides many advantages as will be seen.

## Installation

> :warning: This repo is obsolete. Instead see: https://github.com/kacheryhub/kachery-doc/blob/main/README.md

First, if you do not already have numpy, install it via `pip install numpy` or similar. Then,

```
pip install --upgrade kachery
```

Or a development installation (after cloning this repo and stepping into the directory):

```
pip install -e .
```

You must then create a directory on your computer where cached and temporary
data files will be stored, and then set the KACHERY_STORAGE_DIR environment
variable to point to that directory. For example:

```bash
# Create a directory to store cached and temporary files
mkdir $HOME/.kachery-storage

# Add this to the bottom of your ~/.bashrc file and then open a new terminal
export KACHERY_STORAGE_DIR=$HOME/.kachery-storage
```

See the documentation below for hosting your own kachery server.

## A quick example

> :warning: This repo is obsolete. Instead see: https://github.com/kacheryhub/kachery-doc/blob/main/README.md

First we store some random data file in the local kachery database via the
command-line:

```bash
> kachery-store /path/to/some/dataset.csv
sha1:////3476867b4d9300e4a44e2b910af87b08f8e608bf/dataset.csv
```

Note that this storage operation could also be performed within Python as
documented below.

The returned sha1:// path is now a universal pointer to the file which may be
used in a Python script as follows

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import kachery as ka

path = 'sha1:////3476867b4d9300e4a44e2b910af87b08f8e608bf/dataset.csv'

# Get the path to the cached file
path_local = ka.load_file(path)

# Or load the text of the file directly
dataset_csv_text = ka.load_text(path)

# There are also commands to load a dict from a .json file or an array from a .npy file
# See ka.load_object and ka.load_npy below
```

The advantage is that the above Python script is universal and reproducible in
that it does not depend on the actual location of the file on disk, and it is
(for all practical purposes) guaranteed to always point to the same file content
with the given SHA-1 hash.

Note that the `/dataset.csv` extension on the sha1:// path is for information
purposes only and does not affect the file retrieval in any way.

## Command line

> :warning: This repo is obsolete. Instead see: https://github.com/kacheryhub/kachery-doc/blob/main/README.md

Basic usage examples for files:

```bash
#### Store a file in the local database ####
> kachery-store /path/to/file.dat
sha1://ad7fb868e59c495f355d83f61da1c32cc21571cf/file.dat

#### Load it later on ####
> kachery-load sha1://ad7fb868e59c495f355d83f61da1c32cc21571cf/file.dat --dest file.dat
file.dat

#### Or get info about the file ####
> kachery-info sha1://ad7fb868e59c495f355d83f61da1c32cc21571cf/file.dat 
{
    "path": "/tmp/sha1-cache/a/d7/ad7fb868e59c495f355d83f61da1c32cc21571cf",
    "size": 70600000,
    "sha1": "ad7fb868e59c495f355d83f61da1c32cc21571cf"
}

#### You can also pipe the file content ####
> kachery-cat sha1://ad7fb868e59c495f355d83f61da1c32cc21571cf/file.dat > file.dat

#### Or a portion (byte range) thereof ####
> kachery-cat sha1://ad7fb868e59c495f355d83f61da1c32cc21571cf/file.dat --start 0 --end 180000 > file_portion.dat
```

Basic usage examples for directories:

```bash
#### Store a directory ####
> kachery-store /path/to/directory/ds001
sha1dir://4d329a296cfe0b3142d57226ff881b6572c3ed20.ds001

#### List the contents at a later time ####
> kachery-ls sha1dir://4d329a296cfe0b3142d57226ff881b6572c3ed20.ds001
subdir1/
subdir2/
file1.txt
file2.csv

#### List subdirectories ####
> kachery-ls sha1dir://4d329a296cfe0b3142d57226ff881b6572c3ed20.ds001/subdir1
other_file1.txt
other_file2.txt

#### Show the contents of a file ####
> kachery-cat sha1dir://4d329a296cfe0b3142d57226ff881b6572c3ed20.ds001/subdir1/other_file1.txt
Content of other_file1.txt
```

To share files, simply upload them to a remote kachery server using the --to flag as in the following example:

```bash
#### Store a directory in a remote database ####
# Note that you need to set the KACHERY_DEFAULT_PASSWORD environment variable for this to work properly
> kachery-store /path/to/directory/ds001 --to default_readwrite
sha1dir://4d329a296cfe0b3142d57226ff881b6572c3ed20.ds001

#### Now somebody else on a different computer can retrieve it ####
# No password is needed in this case
> kachery-ls sha1dir://4d329a296cfe0b3142d57226ff881b6572c3ed20.ds001 --fr default_readonly
subdir1/
subdir2/
file1.txt
file2.csv
```

Get more detailed documentation on these commands by using the --help flag:

```bash
kachery-store --help
kachery-load --help
kachery-ls --help
kachery-cat --help
kachery-info --help
```

## Python

> :warning: This repo is obsolete. Instead see: https://github.com/kacheryhub/kachery-doc/blob/main/README.md

The above operations are also accessible from Python scripts along with some crucial helper functions.

```python
import kachery as ka
import numpy as np

#### To store text, a dict, a numpy array, a file, or a directory ####

p_text = ka.store_text('some text')
p_obj = ka.store_object(dict(a=['some', 'object', 'that', 'can', 'be', 'json-serialized']))
p_npy = ka.store_npy(np.ones(12, 12))
p_file = ka.store_file('/path/to/file.dat')
p_dir =ka.store_dir('/path/to/some/directory')

# For example p_text will be something like:
# 'sha1://efceddd6e5aa418f965d29e50cf294c08f6a91ec/file.txt'

#### Then later we can retrieve that data using the load functions ####

txt = ka.load_text(p_text)
obj = ka.load_object(p_obj)
array = ka.load_npy(p_npy)
local_path = ka.load_file(p_file)
bytes0 = ka.load_bytes(p_file, start=0, end=180000)
dir_content = ka.read_dir(p_dir)
txt2 = ka.load_text(p_dir + '/some_file_in_the_dir.txt')
```

We can configure kachery to upload and download to and from a remote kachery database using `set_config` as follows:

```python
import kachery as ka
import numpy as np

#### Configure the kachery client to upload/download from a remote kachery database ####

# In order for this to work, you need to set the appropriate KACHERY_DEFAULT_PASSWORD environment variable
ka.set_config(
    fr='default_readwrite',
    to='default_readwrite'
)

#### The following will now upload to the remote kachery database ####
p_text = ka.store_text('some text')

#### And later someone on a different computer can retrieve that data (using the proper configuration) ####
ka.set_config(
    fr='default_readonly'
)
txt = ka.load_text(p_text)
```

## Hosting a kachery server

> :warning: This repo is obsolete. Instead see: https://github.com/kacheryhub/kachery-doc/blob/main/README.md

To host a kachery server you will need to create a directory
with a kachery.json configuration file inside. For an example
configuration file, see [server/example_kachery.json](server/example_kachery.json). It is possible to configure multiple password-protected channels in order to balance the usage limits for different subsets of users. For example, you may want some subset of users to have download (but not upload) access.

You can either use docker or NodeJS 12.x.x to run the server.
The easiest is to use docker.

For docker instructions, see [server/docker_instructions.txt](server/docker_instructions.txt).
